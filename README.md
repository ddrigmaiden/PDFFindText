# PDFFindText
PDFFindText is a command line utility coded in Python3 that searches a PDF for a series of search terms loaded from a JSON file. Each time a search term is found, it is highlighted in yellow or emphasized with a red box inside the PDF and a bookmark is added to the PDF table of contents linking to the search term's exact location.
